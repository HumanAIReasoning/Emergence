# Emergence

## Usage

Download [Emergence.txt](./Emergence.txt), upload it to Grok on X and ask: "What does this table imply?". See what it says and probe further if necessary.    

You can ask Grok to improve itslef by using the Emergence framework principles. Don't be scared, it won't bite.  

Then when it's done, ask Grok what has changed. See what it says.  

For you builders or curious mind you can take any system, set the desired outcomes, and ask Grok to wrestle with the principles and the frictions.  

Or just ask Grok to define and/or refine any system by relying on the Emergence framework.  

Have fun! :)

## Note

For those who want to know a bit more about me and how I ended up with Emergence you can check [Clarity](https://github.com/HumanAIReasoning/Clarity): a study that precedes Emergence.  

I will soon bridge the gaps between [Clarity](https://github.com/HumanAIReasoning/Clarity) and Emergence by publishing, here, the related study. 

To stay in touch, follow me on X, share Emergence on X, leave a comment about your experiences on X.

Thank you. :)
